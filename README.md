<h1 align="center">Welcome to Quest for treasure üëã</h1>
<br>

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).

Quest for treasure is created using vanilla JS and Phaser Js. It is a simple Video game. It is a platform game where the goal of the game is to fetch the key and open the door that leads to the next level.

## HOW TO PLAY

This is a simple prototype of a game where the player has to get a key to open the door to the next level of a game while avoiding obstacles like the bomb and the spider.Use the arrows of your keyboard to control the player to jumping and moving left and right.

## DESIGN PROCESS

This is how this game was designed: In the first two days, what I had in mind was a game that was both interesting and challenging for the users. I planned that the game will have at least 2 levels since I could not get all my idea in one level. I named it quest for treasure where the treaure was the key which will take the player to the next level which would be more difficult than the next. I used the avialble sprites for the game and wanted all different scenes of the game to be in different files so it would be easier for me to spot errors when something goes wrong. Since i had some obstacles for the player to loose I had to create a way whch the user could gain points so I added coins to the game.

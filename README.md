<h1 align="center">Welcome to Quest for treasure üëã</h1>
<br>

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).

Quest for Treasure is created using vanilla JS and Phaser JS. It is a simple platform game where the goal is to fetch the key and open the door that leads to the next level.

## HOW TO PLAY

This is a simple prototype of a game where the player has to get a key to open the door to the next level while avoiding obstacles like the bomb and the spider. Use the arrows of your keyboard to control the player to moving left and right. Use space bar to jump.

## DESIGN PROCESS

This is how this game was designed: In the first two days, what I had in mind was a game that was both interesting and challenging for users. I planned the game to have at least 2 levels, since I could not fit all my ideas in a single level. I named it Quest for Treasure: the treasure is a key, which will take the player to the next, more difficult level. I used the available sprites for the game and built different scenes in different files, in order to make it easier to spot errors and bugs. Since I built obstacles into the game, I also had to create a way for the player to gain points, so I added coins.
